### Running
When you pull the repository or switch branches, run
```
npm install
```
This should create a folder node_modules in the Cesium-1 directory.
Once you wish to run the server, from the Cesium-1 directory run  
```
node server.js
```
and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
If you make changes to any files while the server is running, it is not
necessary to restart it. All changes will be present once you reload the webpage.
